#  **⚙️📊Scheduling Algorithms – A Visual Approach**

Efficient CPU scheduling is essential for seamless multitasking, ensuring optimal CPU utilization by determining which process runs and when. This project, offers an **interactive and dynamic** visualization of various scheduling algorithms to enhance comprehension of execution order, waiting time, and turnaround time.

---

## 🎯 **Why CPU Scheduling?**
CPU scheduling plays a vital role in **maximizing system efficiency and resource utilization**. Different scheduling algorithms impact key performance metrics:
- ⏳ **Waiting Time** – The duration a process remains in the queue before execution.
- ⌛ **Turnaround Time** – The total time from process arrival to its completion.
- ⚡ **Response Time** – The time taken for the first execution after arrival.

✅Optimized scheduling ensures:

  -> Fair CPU distribution

  -> Higher system throughput

  -> Reduced waiting and response delays
